"""
This module defines the data model for the simulation. Specifically, it provides a class for representing patches of the simulation grid and a class for representing cells that inhabit these patches.


Requirements
------------
Python 3.7 or higher.

Notes
-----
This module provided as material for Phase 1 of the exam project for DM562, DM857, DS830 (2022).
